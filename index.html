            <h1>Yoga is really the art of waking up.</h1>
            <p>Getting back to the true you. It can be that simple. Yoga offers up a way for us to see a world that is working for you instead of against you.</p>
            <p>Yoga reminds me that everything is connected so we must live, act, breathe with awareness. The process is the candy.</p>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
